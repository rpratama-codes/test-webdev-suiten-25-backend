# Rekomendasiin Super App Backend  

I will do with Behavior-driven development (BDD/TDD) with Waterfall Method. This is a store app, but it's not a multi tenant app!. Thread you as a master not a slave like another app!. This is just tool, That you can use. I Mean the whole app, not just the BE only, if just BE, it's also sucks!.
